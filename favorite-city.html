    <h1>My Favorite City: Ibadan</h1>
   <p>Ibadan is an amazing city with rich history and culture. I love the historic buildings, the famous University of Ibadan, and the bustling markets filled with local crafts and vibrant energy!</p>

   <p>My favorite thing about Ibadan is the beautiful mapo House and exploring the traditional Yoruba culture that makes the city so special and unique.</p>
